# twitter-stream-example-files #
- Twitter data gathered from 2-03 to the final analysis day was done in a separate streaming program that was already set up from a previous project (scalawags-grooup-5) and slightly modified to capture a twitter stream using twitter4j and Dstreams.
- The two main scala files that were used for this stream to work can be found in this directory
    - Main was used to run the stream
    - saveData was used to make a new copy of the stream every hour
