# Twitter-COVID
## Project Description
Here you will find a collection of modules that are part of a much larger project related to the analysis of COVID-19 data.  The full project can be found at https://github.com/891-MehrabRahmen-CovidAnalysis/covid-analysis-1

* **age-spikes-discussion**:
  * Is the trend of the global COVID-19 discussion increasing or decreasing?
  * Do spikes in infection rates of the 25 and under age range in Europe affect the volume of discussion on Twitter?
* **hashtag-by-region**:
  * What are the Twitter hashtags used to describe COVID-19 by Region (e.g. #covid, #COVID-19, #Coronavirus, #NovelCoronavirus)?
* **period-most-discussed**:
  * Which dates had the highest volume of Covid discussion on Twitter?
  * Which months had the highest volume of Covid discussion on Twitter?
  * What time of day has the highest volume of Covid discussion on Twitter?
