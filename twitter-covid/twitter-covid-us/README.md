# Twitter COVID US
## About
This application is a single module of a much larger project related to the analysis of COVID-19 data. The full project can be found at https://github.com/891-MehrabRahman-CovidAnalysis/covid-analysis-1

This module serves to answer the following question:
Do spikes in infection rates of the 5-30 age range affect the volume of discussion?

To answer this question, the application uses Apache Spark with a dataset of approximately 20 million hydrated tweets gathered from the Twitter API's COVID-19 endpoint and a dataset of COVID-19 cases in the United States.

## Environment Information
This application makes use of these technologies:
* Java JDK 11
* Scala 2.12.13
* sbt version 1.4.5
* Apache Spark 3.0.1
* AWS S3
* AWS EMR

## Usage
* Ensure that your AWS credentials are stored as environment variables.
* Update the path variable in src/main/scala/main/TwitterCovidAnalysis.scala to point to your data source.
* Update the spark variable in src/main/scala/main/Main.scala to your desired configuration settings, if necessary.
* Assuming your credentials and paths are correct, you can use `sbt run` to run the program locally, or you can use `sbt assembly` to create a jar file in target/scala-2.12, which can then be uploaded to a remote cluster to be executed.
* Use `sbt test` to execute the unit tests.  Test results will be printed to console, as well as stored in logs/test/test_results.log
