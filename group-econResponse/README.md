## Description
The Economic Response Group is one of the teams working on a larger Covid-19 project that is responsible for the building applications that ran analytics to answer questions pertaining to the global, economic impacts of the pandemic on various regions around the world. 

This application uses Spark SQL and AWS EMRto query Covid and economic dataset to answer the following questions:

* Is there a significant relationship between a Regionâ€™s cumulative GDP and Infection Rate per capita?
* What is the average amount of time it took for each region to reach its first peak in infection rate per capita?
* Which Regions handled COVID-19 the best assuming our metrics are change in GDP by percentage and COVID-19 infection rate per capita. 
* What are the top 5 landlocked countries with the highest infection rates? 

## Main Feature:
To simplify development and maintenance we used a single build.sbt file for all applications. 
Allows for centralized configuration, dependency and build management.     

Also allows us to aggregate a utilities app Into each other application to share Its resources.
